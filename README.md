# Heartbeat-Monitoring-system-using-Arduino
# Overview
This project utilizes an Arduino board and a pulse sensor to create an efficient heart rate monitoring system. The pulse sensor captures heartbeats and transmits the data to the Arduino for processing.

# Features
Real-time Heart Rate Monitoring: Displays heart rate on an LCD screen or sends data to a computer for analysis.
User-friendly Interface: Simple setup for easy monitoring.
Educational Use: Ideal for learning about sensor integration and health monitoring systems.

# How it Works

A heartbeat monitoring system with Arduino works by using an IR sensor to detect changes in blood flow, which generates an analog signal that the Arduino reads to identify heartbeats; it then counts these beats over a set time period to calculate the heart rate in beats per minute (BPM) and displays the result on a serial monitor or LCD screen.

# Components Required
1. Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
2. Pulse sensor
3. LCD display (optional)
4. Breadboard
5. Connecting wires
6. Power supply
