# Heartbeat-Monitoring-system-using-Arduino
# Overview
This project utilizes an Arduino board and a pulse sensor to create an efficient heart rate monitoring system. The pulse sensor captures heartbeats and transmits the data to the Arduino for processing.

# Features
Real-time Heart Rate Monitoring: Displays heart rate on an LCD screen or sends data to a computer for analysis.
User-friendly Interface: Simple setup for easy monitoring.
Educational Use: Ideal for learning about sensor integration and health monitoring systems.

# Components Required
Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno), 
Pulse sensor, 
LCD display (optional), 
Breadboard, 
Connecting wires
